# NBA-PPG-analysis

For this Project, I take a look at what variable plays the largest part in the average points per game a player can score in the NBA. 

There is no question that the team which scores the most points in a game wins, an age-old answer to Sports. In this analysis we will be observing how the PPG (Points Per Game) relates to other statistics within an NBA game. 

Data is gathered by requesting an URL and parsing through the page to scrape statistical data on the statistics for 2020-2021 season.

We then narrowed down our data to variables which related to the amount of points a player scored throughout a game. 

In order to do this we made a quick basketball scraper function to gather data from basketball-reference.com

Overall, we found that there is a high correlation between points scored per game and the minutes played, field goals attempted and free throw attempted in a game. I highly recommend checking out the notebook file for a walkthrough of the data analysis.
